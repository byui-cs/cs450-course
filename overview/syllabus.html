        <h2>CS 450 Syllabus</h2>


            <h3>Course Information</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Course: CS 450 - An Introduction to Machine Learning &amp; Data Mining</p></li>
            <li><p>Prerequisites: CS 241 or CS 246</p></li>
            <li><p>Text: Marsland, <em>Machine Learning, An Algorithmic Approach, 2nd Edition</em></p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The textbook is also available online through <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/byuidaho/detail.action?docID=11167170&p00=9781466583337" target="_blank">our library subscription</a>.</p>

            <p>During the second half of the semester, we will also refer to a few chapters from the e-book, <a href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/byuidaho/detail.action?docID=10794279" target="_blank">Machine Learning with R</a></p>
            <h3>Objectives/Outcomes</h3>
            <p>My hope is that at the end of this course each student will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Be excited about machine learning and data mining</p></li>
                <li><p>Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting with it</p></li>
                <li><p>Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in machine learning / data mining</p></li>
                <li><p>Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.</p></li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>To achieve these outcomes, we will have assignments and assessments in the following areas:</p>

                <h4>Readiness Assurance Tests</h4>
            <p>There will be assigned reading material each week from the textbook and other online sources. Each student is expected to come to class Monday prepared and will be given a short readiness assurance test individually and as a group to verify this.</p>
                <h4>Individual Assignments</h4>
            <p>Each week, there will be an individual assignment that reinforces the concepts discussed. Some of these will be Python programs, others will be experimentation and analysis using existing tools.</p>
                <h4>Team Project</h4>
            <p>Students will spend the majority of the second half of the semester working on a team project. For this project, each team will select and obtain a dataset of their choosing and mine it to discover new and interesting insights.</p>
                <h4>Exams</h4>
            <p>There will be a midterm and final exam administered in class.</p>
            <h3>GRADING POLICY</h3>
            <p>Grades will be assigned according to the following breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Readiness Assurance Tests: 15%</p></li>
                <li><p>Individual Assignments/Projects: 40%</p></li>
                <li><p>Team Project: 30%</p></li>
                <li><p>Exams: 15%</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Assessments</h4>
            <p>Grades for most assignments (unless otherwise noted) are assigned in broad terms according to the following scale:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>50% - Some attempt was made</p></li>
                <li><p>70% - Developing, but significantly deficient</p></li>
                <li><p>85% - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate</p></li>
                <li><p>93% - Meets requirements</p></li>
                <li><p>100% - Shows creativity, and a desire to excel above and beyond</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
            <p>Be responsible for your own education. You may work with your classmates, but all individual work that is submitted must be original. When programming, share ideas but do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>
            <p>I encourage you to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone else's work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. When in doubt, give credit and be upfront.</p>
            <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: a zero on the assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the university.</p>
            <h3>Changes to Schedule and Assignments</h3>
            <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes in class and on the course website.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>BYU-Idaho is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by BYU-Idaho Disability Services. If you need assistance or feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established policy and procedures.</p>

            <h3>Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>
            <p>BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Prohibited sex discrimination includes incidents of sexual harassment (including sexual violence), dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking (collectively "sexual misconduct").</p>
 
            <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. University policy requires that I report all incidents of sexual misconduct that come to my attention. If you encounter sexual misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@byui.edu or 208-496-9200. Additional information about sexual misconduct and available resources can be found at www.byui.edu/titleix.</p>

        <h3>Changes to Schedule and Assignments</h3>
        <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes on I-learn.</p>
