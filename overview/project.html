            <h2>CSE 450 Team Project Requirements</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>The semester long team project will provide a chance for you to demonstrate mastery of the principles of machine learning and data mining.</p>
            <p>In teams of three (two if necessary, rather than four), you will select your own data mining project and work on it throughout the semester to discover something interesting.</p>

            <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
            <p>The following are the line items of the final project rubric. You should choose a project that is meaningful/challenging enough for you to demonstrate mastery in each of these areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data</p></li>
                <li><p>Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>(e.g., data set size, complexity of features, missing data, redundant attributes, obtaining the data, etc.)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>Demonstrates proper algorithm selection and application</p></li>
                <li><p>Discovered something interesting / of value</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>(e.g., about the data, about the algorithms and their limitations in this context, something actionable for a stakeholder, etc.)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>Demonstrates understanding of limitations of the solution and potential ethical issues</p></li>
                <li><p>Conversant in appropriate terminology and technologies</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mastery will be observed throughout the semester and specifically demonstrated via a final project report.</p>
