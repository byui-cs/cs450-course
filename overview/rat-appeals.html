            <h3>Submitting an Appeal</h3>
            <p>Your team can appeal any missed questions on Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs). The appeal must me made in writing according to the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Specify the question being appealed.</p></li>
                <li><p>Specify the reason for appeal as:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Ambiguity/incorrectness in the question -- The question and/or answers should be changed or reworded.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Ambiguity in the reading material -- The question was adequate but the reading material could have logically led to a different answer.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>Describe the source of the ambiguity.</p></li>
                <li><p>For ambiguous questions, provide a new version of the question and answers that would be more appropriate.</p></li>
                <li><p>For ambiguous reading material, provide supporting material via a quotation and page number or URL of the reference.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Results on Scoring</h3>
            <p>If approved, the following adjustments will be made to the scores of the team that appealed. Teams that did not appeal will receive no scoring adjustments.</p>

            <p>For the successfully appealing team, the points missed will be added to:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Their team RAT score</p></li>
                <li><p>The score of any individual in the team who answered the same as the team.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Team members who had the original correct answer will continue to receive credit for the question.</p>
