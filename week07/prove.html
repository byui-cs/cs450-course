            <h2>07 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Part 2</p>


            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, back-propagation for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <p>Please note that you have 3 weeks to implement and experiment with this algorithm. This is because it can be a challenge! <b>This is likely the most challenging individual programming assignment we will do this semester</b>. Do not put this off!</p>

            <p>The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you are on track to be successful with this assignment.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p>As stated in last week's assignment, you can choose between implementing a neural network or doing in-depth experimenting with a library implementation. Depending on your choice, please complete the following steps in one category or the other. (If you previously started down one path, but have decided to switch to the other option, you should complete last week's requirements for that option, and then complete this week's.)</p>

            <h4>Implementation Option</h4>
            <p>If you have chosen to implement a neural network yourself, by the end of this week your goal is to be able to construct a multi-layer neural network of arbitrary configuration (i.e., number of layers, and number of nodes per layer) and use that network to make classifications on a dataset. At this point, it will be at best random guessing, because we won't have the backpropagation/learning piece finished yet. But you should be able to run it and get results.</p>

            <p>At a more specific level, you need to have at least the following completed this week:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Build a classifier with an arbitrary number of layers, and an arbitrary number of nodes in each layer.</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>For example: 2 Layers (1 hidden, 1 output), with 4 nodes in the hidden layer, and 3 output nodes.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Or 3 Layers (2 hidden, 1 output), with 2 nodes in the first, 3 in the second, 1 in the third.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Or 2 Layers (1 hidden, 1 output) with 8 nodes in the hidden layer, and 2 in the output.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Etc.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>The number of weights for the first layer should be determined by the number of input attributes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Biases are present at every layer.</p></li>
                <li><p>You should be able to complete the feed-forward portion of the algorithm, looping through each node of each layer to produce values at the output layer.</p></li>
                <li><p>For your activation function, use the sigmoid function: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)</p></li>
                <li><p>You should be able to classify an instance using your network. Please note that at this point, you will not have implemented any weight updates, so your network will essentially be randomly computing an answer, but it should be able to classify a given instance.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using the classification described, you should be able to classify a complete dataset and calculate the accuracy. (E.g., try it on the iris dataset)</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that this week, we are still not implementing the error calculation and back-propagation. We will finish that up next week and then have some time to experiment with different datasets and network configurations. If you can get that part done this week as well, you will be better off, but the minimum standard for this week is to complete the feed forward network as described above.</p>

            <h4>Experimentation Option</h4>
            <p>If you have selected the experimentation option, this week your task is to use a library implementation to make predictions on several different datasets of different characteristics. Then, next week, you will pick one or two of these datasets and experiment with various hyper-parameter combinations.</p>

            <p>In particular, you should use and make predictions on <strong>at least four different datasets</strong>. Then, among your datasets you should make sure that you have worked with at least the following characteristics in some form:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Text values</p></li>
                <li><p>A significant amount of columns</p></li>
                <li><p>A significant amount of rows</p></li>
                <li><p>Binary classification (only two possible values)</p></li>
                <li><p>Classification with more than two target values</p></li>
                <li><p>Regression (numeric target values)</p></li>
                <li><p>Look at different measures of success for your datasets (more than just accuracy)</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>This does not mean that you must use a different dataset for each of the above characteristics, nor does it mean that one dataset needs to cover all of them. You may have one dataset that covers a few, and other that covers others.</p>

            <p>In the end, your goal is to have prepared and made predictions on a number of different datasets so that you can choose a "hard" one or two from among them that you will focus on next week.</p>

            <p>It is your task to find these datasets. One potential resource to consider is the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a> from which many of our datasets this semester have come.</p>


            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>Because this is a milestone toward next week's assignment, this assignment does not specifically require (or reward) going above and beyond. That will be addressed in the assignment for next week.</p>

            <p>You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond these deliverables because that will help you finish the assignment for next week.</p>

            <p>When complete, answer the questions in the accompanying I-Learn quiz.</p>
