            <h2>07 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Part 2</p>


            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, back-propagation for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <p>Please note that you have 3 weeks to experiment with this algorithm. This is because it can be a challenge! <b>This is likely the most challenging individual programming assignment we will do this semester</b>. Do not put this off!</p>

            <p>The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you are on track to be successful with this assignment.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>This week your task is to use a library implementation to make predictions on several different datasets of different characteristics. Then, next week, you will pick one or two of these datasets and experiment with various hyper-parameter combinations.</p>

            <p>In particular, you should use and make predictions on <strong>at least four different datasets</strong>. Then, among your datasets you should make sure that you have worked with at least the following characteristics in some form:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Text values</p></li>
                <li><p>A significant amount of columns</p></li>
                <li><p>A significant amount of rows</p></li>
                <li><p>Binary classification (only two possible values)</p></li>
                <li><p>Classification with more than two target values</p></li>
                <li><p>Regression (numeric target values)</p></li>
                <li><p>Look at different measures of success for your datasets (more than just accuracy)</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>This does not mean that you must use a different dataset for each of the above characteristics, nor does it mean that one dataset needs to cover all of them. You may have one dataset that covers a few, and other that covers others.</p>

            <p>In the end, your goal is to have prepared and made predictions on a number of different datasets so that you can choose a "hard" one or two from among them that you will focus on next week.</p>

            <p>It is your task to find these datasets. One potential resource to consider is the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a> from which many of our datasets this semester have come.</p>


            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>Because this is a milestone toward next week's assignment, this assignment does not specifically require (or reward) going above and beyond. That will be addressed in the assignment for next week.</p>

            <p>You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond these deliverables because that will help you finish the assignment for next week.</p>

            <p>When complete, answer the questions in the accompanying I-Learn quiz.</p>
