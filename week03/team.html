            <h2>03 Teach : Team Project - Team Formation</h2>


            <p>This week, you need to form teams for your semester data mining projects. The target size for these teams is three people, but having two or four may be approved as an exception. Please refer to the <a href="../overview/project.html" target="_blank">Team Project Requirements</a> for more information about the scope and requirements of the project.
            </p>
            <p>Then, based on some of the brainstorming ideas you shared previously, please self-organize.</p>
            <p>When you have decided on a team, please submit a plain text document with the following information:</p>
            <p>1. List the members of the proposed team.</p>
            <p>2. Briefly describe your high-level idea for a project.</p>
            <p>Please note that the instructor reserves the right to assign team members / change teams, especially in the case that someone fails to pick a team or there are inconsistencies regarding proposed members.</p>
