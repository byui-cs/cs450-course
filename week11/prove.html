            <h2>11 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Ensemble Learning</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Be able to combine different machine learning algorithms in different forms of ensembles.</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>This assignment is very open-ended. Your task is choose a few different datasets and apply different classification algorithms to these datasets, both individually and in different kinds of ensembles.</p>
            <p>In particular, the following are the specific baseline requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Select 3 different datasets of your choice.</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Choose some that you think will be difficult to learn on, so that you can see the benefits of the ensembles play out. The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html" title="UCI Repository">UCI repository</a> is the source of many of the ones we have used this semester.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>For each dataset:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Try at least 3 different "regular" learning algorithms and note the results.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use Bagging and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use AdaBoost and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use a random forest and note the results. (Play around with a few different options)</p></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>When complete, note the experiments and accuracies in the accompanying assessment.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that in Python, these algorithms are available in the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html" target="_BLANK">sklearn-ensemble package</a>. In Weka, they be found in the "meta" category.</p>
            <p>As always, you are encouraged to go above and beyond by experimenting on several more datasets of different make-ups, as well as significant experimentation with the algorithms and their parameters.</p>
            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>When complete, fill out the <a href="./prove11.txt" target="_BLANK">submission form</a> and upload it to I-Learn.</p>
