            <h2>08 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Classifier</p>


            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, back-propagation for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>

            <p>This assignment is the culmination of the previous weeks' work.</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>As stated in the previous assignment, you can choose between implementing a neural network or doing in-depth experimenting with a library implementation. Depending on your choice, please complete the following steps in one category or the other. (If you previously started down one path, but have decided to switch to the other option, you should complete the previous week's requirements for that option, and then complete this week's.)</p>

            <h3>Implementation Option</h3>
            <p>Your assignment this week is to <b>finish</b> the neural network you previously started (by converting it to a mult-layer network and adding backpropagation for training), and then to <b>experiment</b> with it on various datasets.</p>

            <p>After implementing the algorithm, use it to classify <strong>two</strong> datasets of your choice. For each one, experiment with different hyper-parameters for the algorithm.</p>

            <h4>Minimum Standard Requirements</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Implement the basic MLP algorithm.</p></li>
                <li><p>Produce a graph of your learner's accuracy on the validation set (or the training set if necessary) per iteration of the algorithm.</p>
                    <p>You can use a Python graphing library to do this directly as you go, or if you are more comfortable with something else, you are welcome to output the data to a text file and then use another utility to produce the graph (e.g., Excel, R).</p></li>

                <li><p>Basic experimentation</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Demonstrate that your algorithm can learn on two different datasets.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Try various configurations (# of layers, # of nodes per layer)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Produce graphs of the training progress</p></li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h4>Opportunities To Go Above And Beyond:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>More elaborate stopping criteria</p></li>
                <li><p>Significant experimentation (Seek out additional datasets, compare and contrast many different configurations, experiment with different strategies for starting weights and normalization, etc.)</p></li>
                <li><p>Regression</p></li>
                <li><p>Different activation functions (e.g., tanh)</p></li>
                <li><p>Implement batch and sequential update, and compare results</p></li>
                <li><p>Using momentum</p></li>
                <li><p>Any other ideas you have</p></li>
            </ul>
<!--             <h3>Questions for Consideration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>How should categorical data be handled?</p></li>
                <li><p>How many layers should be in your network?</p></li>
                <li><p>How many nodes should be in each hidden layer?</p></li>
                <li><p>How many nodes should be in the output layer (e.g., one? one per class?)?</p></li>
                <li><p>When should learning be stopped?</p></li>
            </ul>
 -->
            <h3>Experimentation Option</h3>
            <p>In the previous weeks you should have used a library implementation of a neural network to classify several different datasets of different characteristics.</p>
            <p>Your assignment this week is to pick one of the datasets that you found to be fairly challenging to get good results on. Then, using this challenging dataset, spend significant time trying different hyper-parameter combinations, to discover the configuration that gives the best results.</p>

            <p>You should consider varying things such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Number of layers</p></li>
                <li><p>Number of nodes per layer</p></li>
                <li><p>Stopping criteria / length of training time</p></li>
                <li><p>Using momentum</p></li>
                <li><p>Using different activation functions</p></li>
                <li><p>Any other parameters provided by your library</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Minimum Standard Requirements</h4>
            <p>Including the work done in this week and the previous weeks, you should then have completed at a minimum:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Successfully used a library implementation of a neural network to make predictions.</p></li>
                <li><p>Done the necessary preprocessing work to prepare several different datasets for this library.</p></li>
                <li><p>Used datasets that show you can work with various kinds of input data (e.g., categorical vs numeric, etc.).</p></li>
                <li><p>Made predictions using both regression and classification.</p></li>
                <li><p>Performed significant hyper-parameter experimentation and tuning for a challenging dataset.</p></li>
            </ol>
