            <h2>Helpful Hints for using SVMs in R</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>As noted, you may use any implementation of the SVM algorithm that you choose, and I would recommend reading over <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Classification/SVM" target="_blank" title="SVM Tutorial">this tutorial</a>, which will walk you through the process of how to use the LIBSVM library.</p>

            <h3>Hints</h3>
            <p>A few additionally notes that may be helpful.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>To install the LIBSVM package you need to run:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><code>install.packages('e1071', dependencies = TRUE)</code></p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>Then, to load it, you run:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><code>library (e1071)</code></p></li>
                </ul>

                <li><p>The RBF kernel to experiment with is called "radial"</p></li>

                <li><p>If the column you are trying to predict is numeric, the SVM algorithm will default to regression. You can force it to use classification with a type="C" parameter.</p></li>

                <li><p>In order to use the <code>testset[,-2]</code> notation, you need to know which index your class value is, and remember that it is 1-based. Please note that in Python "-2" means, two from the end. In R, "-2" means, everything except 2.</p></li>

                <li><p>The tutorial above shows you how to create a confusion matrix with a command such as: <code>confusion_matrix&nbsp;&lt;- table(pred = prediction, true = testset[,2])</code></p></li>
                <li><p>You can also compute the accuracy using something like the following (assuming the dataset is "vowel_test" and the column of interest is called "Class":</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><code>agreement &lt;- prediction == vowel_test$Class</code></p></li>
                    <li><p><code>accuracy &lt;- prop.table(table(agreement))</code></p></li>
                </ul>
                <li><p>At the risk of making this assignment too easy, and not helping you learn R as well as you should. You might also consider: <a href="./svm-hints-part2.html">even more helpful hints for using SVMs in R</a>.</p></li>
