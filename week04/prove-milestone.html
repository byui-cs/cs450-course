            <h2>04 Prove : Milestone</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Decision Tree Classifier</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Regardless of the approach you choose, the decision tree assignment can be somewhat challenging. To help you stay on track to completing the assignment, please complete the following portions of the assignment by the day noted in I-Learn.</p>



            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p>First, Make sure you are familiar with <a href="./prove.html" target="_blank">the instructions for the complete assignment</a> and know which option you are taking. Then get started on your assignment by completing the steps noted for the assignment option you selected.</li>

            <h4>Implementation Option</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Create a class for your decision tree classifier.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that you can read in a dataset with discrete values and send it to your classifier. It is just fine to pre-process the data in another program or script to prepare it, but you need to have at least some data for your algorithm at this point.</p>
                    <p>You may choose to use a Pandas dataframe and keep the discrete values as strings or something similar, or you may want to use a numpy array, in which case, you can convert the discrete values to integers (i.e., label encoding).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Have a mechanism for representing your tree, along with branches, leaf nodes, and how it will store attributes and target values.</p>
                    <p>This is purposefully left vague. Some students have chosen to use classes and had a Node class to represent this, whereas others have used dictionaries of dictionaries, or some combination of the above.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><p>Write a function that can calculate entropy, and verify that it computes the correct value (check it by hand) for cases with both two classes, and also more than two classes.</p></li>

                <li><p>Start coding a recursive function to build a tree that can partition the data it receives according to the value of an attribute. And, ensure that will call itself.</p></li>

                <li><p>Have the logic in place for at least the base cases of the recursive algorithm. (The algorithm/function may not work yet, but you should at least have this code in place.)</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Experimentation Option</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Correctly load and build a tree for at least one dataset.</p></li>
<!--             <li><p>Use different encoding options for any categorical data present.</p></li>
 -->            
            <li><p>Produce a visualization of the tree.</p></li>
            <li><p>Play around with various parameters of the algorithm.</p></li>
<!--             <li><p>Identify options for handling missing data that you might consider and look up information about how to use them.</p></li>
 -->            
            <li><p>Investigate options to limit the size of your tree and look up information about how to use them. (So that you can be prepared to use them next week.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Determine the other datasets you will use, and learn about the types of data in each one, so that you can formulate a plan to correctly use them.</p></li>
            <li><p>Start your PDF report.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Answer the questions in the accompanying I-Learn assessment. It asks you to enumerate which of the above steps (1-6) are complete.</p>
