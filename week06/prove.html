            <h2>06 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Part 1</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, the back-propagation algorithm for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <p>Please note that you have 3 weeks to experiment with this algorithm. This is because it can be a challenge! This is likely <strong>the most challenging</strong> individual programming assignment we will do this semester. Do not put this off until later!</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p>You are welcome to use any off-the-shelf neural network library you like, but we strongly suggest that you use <a href="https://keras.io" target="_blank">Keras</a>, which is an API wrapper that makes using Google TensorFlow much easier.</p>

            <p>Make progress toward your final experiments by completing the following this week:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Load at least one dataset of your choice. You should choose something more interesting than loading the built-in Iris dataset.</p></li>
                <li><p>Appropriately prepare your dataset for a neural network, which may include handling missing data, normalizing numeric values, etc.</p>
                    <p>Also, make sure to split your dataset into a training and test set.</p></li>
                <li><p>Identify a neural network library and learn about its parameters and how to use it.</p></li>
                <li><p>Train a neural network with your dataset.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use your network to make predictions about a test set and note the success of the algorithm on your dataset.</p>
                <li><p>Experiment with at least 3 different sets of hyper-parameters for the algorithm (e.g., different number of layers and nodes per layer, different learning rates, different activation functions, etc.).</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Because we are not finishing the assignment at this point, this assignment does not specifically require (or reward) going above and beyond. That will be addressed in a future assignment.</p>
            <p>You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond these expectations because that will help you finish the complete assignment.</p>
            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>When complete, answer the questions in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
            <p>These questions simply ask you to enumerate which of the above steps you have completed.</p>
