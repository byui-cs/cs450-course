            <h2>06 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Part 1</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, the back-propagation algorithm for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <p>Please note that you have 3 weeks to implement and/or experiment with this algorithm. This is because it can be a challenge! This is likely <strong>the most challenging</strong> individual programming assignment we will do this semester. Do not put this off until later!</p>

            <h3>Choose Your Own Adventure</h3>
            <p>As with the Decision Tree assignment, you may choose either the Implementation Option or the Experimentation option for the Neural Network assignment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Implementation Option - Build a multi-layer perceptron neural network that uses backpropagation to learn. Use this network to make predictions on a dataset of your choice and compare to an existing, off-the-shelf library implementation.</p></li>
                <li><p>Experimentation Option - Use an existing, off-the-shelf library implementation of a multi-layer neural network to make predictions on several different datasets, and experiment with several different hyper-parameter combinations, comparing and contrasting their results.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation Option</h3>
            <p>You will be adding to your experiment shell from the previous assignment, by implementing a multi-layer perceptron neural network.</p>
            <p>You will finish the assignment in future weeks, however, to help you make progress, you need to have at least the following completed this week:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Create some type of mechanism to represent your nodes (i.e. neurons) and their associated weights.</p></li>
                <li><p>Provide a way to create a single layer of nodes of any number (this should be easily specified via a parameter).</p></li>
                <li><p>Account for a bias input.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Be able to take input from a dataset instance (with an arbitrary number of attributes) and have each node produce an output (i.e., 0 or 1) according to its weights.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Be able to load and process at least one dataset of your choice.</p></li>
                <li><p>You should appropriately normalize the data set.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Notice that at this point, we are NOT implementing any sort of training or learning in our algorithm. The point of this part of the assignment is to make sure you have the basics of a network of nodes in place that can handle a real instance from a dataset.</p>
            <p>Next week, we will extend this classifier to handle multiple layers of nodes, and implement the back-propagation algorithm for updating weights. Then, it will be much more interesting ;-).</p>

            <h3>Experimentation Option</h3>
            <p>Make progress toward your final experiments by completing the following this week:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Load at least one dataset of your choice. You should choose something more interesting than loading the built-in Iris dataset.</p></li>
                <li><p>Appropriately prepare your dataset for a neural network, which may include handling missing data, normalizing numeric values, etc.</p>
                    <p>Also, make sure to split your dataset into a training and test set.</p></li>
                <li><p>Identify a neural network library and learn about its parameters and how to use it.</p></li>
                <li><p>Train a neural network with your dataset.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use your network to make predictions about a test set and note the success of the algorithm on your dataset.</p>
                <li><p>Experiment with at least 3 different sets of hyper-parameters for the algorithm (e.g., different number of layers and nodes per layer, different learning rates, different activation functions, etc.).</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Because we are not finishing the assignment at this point, this assignment does not specifically require (or reward) going above and beyond. That will be addressed in a future assignment.</p>
            <p>You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond these expectations because that will help you finish the complete assignment.</p>
            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>When complete, answer the questions in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
            <p>These questions simply ask you to enumerate which of the above steps you have completed.</p>
