            <h2>05 Prove : Assignment</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Neural Network Part 1</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Understand Neural Networks, in particular, back-propagation for multi-layer perceptron networks.</p>
            <p>Please note that you have 3 weeks to implement and experiment with this algorithm. This is because it can be a challenge! This is likely <strong>the most challenging</strong> individual programming assignment we will do this semester. Do not put this off until later!</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>You will be adding to your experiment shell created previously, by implementing a multi-layer perceptron neural network.</p>
            <p>You will finish the assignment in two weeks (and there are two more assignments for that), however, to help encourage you to get started this week, you need to have at least the following completed this week:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Create some type of data structure to hold a node (a.k.a. neuron).</p></li>
                <li><p>Store the set of input weights for each node.</p></li>
                <li><p>Provide a way to create a layer of nodes of any number (this should be easily specified via a parameter).</p></li>
                <li><p>Account for a bias input.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Be able to take input from a dataset instance (with an arbitrary number of attributes) and have each node produce an output (i.e., 0 or 1) according to its weights.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Be able to load and process at least the following two datasets:</p></li>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Iris (You didn't think we could leave this out did you!)</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes" target="_BLANK">Pima Indian Diabetes</a></p></li>
                </ol>
                <li><p>You should appropriately normalize each data set.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Notice that at this point, we are NOT implementing any sort of training or learning in our algorithm. The point of this part of the assignment is to make sure you have the basics of a network of nodes in place that can handle a real instance from a dataset.</p>
            <p>Next week, we will extend this classifier to handle multiple layers of nodes, and implement the back-propagation algorithm for updating weights. Then, it will be much more interesting ;-).</p>
            <h3>Experiment Guidelines</h3>
            <p>Because we are not implementing a complete algorithm at this point, you are not expected to experiment with different datasets and parameters at this point, nor does this assignment specifically require (or reward) going above and beyond. That will be addressed in the assignment for next week.</p>
            <p>You are, of course, encouraged to go beyond these deliverables because that will help you finish the algorithm for next week.</p>
            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>When complete, answer the questions in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
