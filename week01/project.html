            <h2>01 Teach : Semester Project First Thoughts</h2>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>A major portion of this semester will be devoted to a semester data mining project of your choosing. We will discuss specific requirements in more detail later on, but at this point it is sufficient to say that your task is to obtain a dataset and mine it to discover something interesting.</p>
            <p>To help get this process started, this week, you need to post at least one idea to the Slack project brainstorming channel associated with your section.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Post at least one idea to the slack project brainstorming channel of a dataset, type of data, or an area that you have some interest in. This is not a commitment to work on this project, but rather a chance to share some ideas and explore together. Over the following week or two, you should begin to settle on a basic idea of the data or area that you want to pursue. Then, you'll have opportunities to look more into feasibility, etc.</p>

            <p>Posting an idea might include starting a new thread, or it might include further developing/discussing an idea started by someone else.</p>

            <p>Remember, there are a lot of us, so keep these very brief and to the point. A sentence or two or a few bullet points should be sufficient.</p>

            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>You will need to post something by Saturday night to receive credit for this assignment. When you have posted something to Slack, please take this "quiz" that allows you to self-report that you have participated.</p>
