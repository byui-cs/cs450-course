            <h2>01 Teach : Team Activity - Python Practice</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>This activity is designed to be completed in teams during class time.</p>
            <p>In this activity you'll be practicing elements of Python that will be useful in your programming this semester.</p>

            <p>You've been hired by ACE Ice Cream Inc. to study their sales data. They suspect that ice cream sales are <em>positively correlated</em> with the temperature, meaning that when the temperature increases, so do ice cream sales. They would like to quantify this.</p>


            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <ul class="small-list">
                <li><p>Make sure you have a Python environment set up for data science work.</p></li>
                <li><p>Review basic statistics used in data science.</p></li>
                <li><p>Practicing using the numpy library.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="a-word-on-notation">A Word on Notation</h3>

            <p>When referring to a list or set of things in the formulas below, we'll use a capital letter, such as $X$.</p> 

            <p>When referring to a single item from that list, we'll use the lowercase letter, $x$. </p>
            
            <p>The letter $n$ almost always refers to the number of items in a collection.</p>
            
            <p>The symbol $x_1$ means the first item in the collection $X$, and $x_i$ means the "ith" item in the collection $X$.</p>
            
            <p>The sigma symbol means to add all of the values over a range. For example:</p>
            <p>$$ total = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$</p>
            <p>Means the "total" can be calculated by adding all of the values in $X$ from $x_1$ (the first value) to $x_n$ (the "nth" or last value).</p>
            <p>In some formula, sigma ranging from 1 to n is abbreviated as simply: $\Sigma$</p>


            <h3 id="stats-review">Statistics Review</h3>
            <p>The following is a review of some basic statistics used in data science that you'll use in this activity. After completing this activity, you may want to refer back to this section and review it again in greater detail.</p>

            <h4 id="mean-median-and-mode">Mean, Median, and Mode</h4>
            <p>Many data science operations require us to do something with the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/v/mean-median-and-mode">mean, median, and / or mode</a> of a <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html">collection of items</a>.</p>
            
            <p>To refer to the mean value of a list $X$, we'll use the symbol $\bar{x}$ (pronounced "x-bar").</p>
            <p>To calculate $\bar{x}$, we add up all of the values in the list, and divide the sum by the total number of items, $n$:</p>
            <p>$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$</p>
            <p>This can be calculated in Python fairly easily:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python"># Verbose version
def mean(X):
    total = sum(X)
    length = len(X)

    return total / length

# More compact version
def mean(X):
    return sum(X) / len(X)</code></pre>

<p>One of the advantages of python is the number of built in modules it has to accomplish common tasks. One such module is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#module-statistics">statistics</a> module</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">import statistics

X = [1,4,4,5,2,500]

mean = statistics.mean(X)
median = statistics.median(X)
mode = statistics.mode(X)

print(&quot;Mean {0}, Median {1}, Mode {2}&quot;.format(mean, median, mode))</code></pre>

<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-text">Mean 86, Median 4.0, Mode 4</code></pre>

            <p>Notice how the mean is strongly affected by the large <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/outliers.html">outlier</a> of 500, while the median is not affected. For this reason, we sometimes prefer the median over the mean in certain situations.</p>

            <p>While the <code>statistics</code> module is fine for casual work, the <code>numpy</code> library has optimized versions of these functions which not only work directly with numpy arrays, but are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37533666/why-is-statistics-mean-so-slow/37533799#37533799" target="_blank">orders of magnitude faster</a> than the standard library versions. This is because many of numpy's functions are implemented in C.</p>

            <h4 id="demean">DeMean</h4>
            
            <p>To "demean" a list of values is to subtract the mean value from each item in the list.</p>
            
            <p>This technique is sometimes called "centering the data", because if you were to graph the data on a number line, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/quantitative-data-ap/mean-median-more/a/mean-as-the-balancing-point">the mean is the point at which the line could be "balanced"</a>, and subtracting the mean from each item causes that balance point to shift to 0.</p>

            <p>So if you start with this list:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">[1, 4, 5, 3, 2]
# The mean is: (1 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 2) / 5  = 3</code></pre>

            <p>After demeaning it (subtracting 3 in this case), you end up with:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">[-2, 1, 2, 0, -1]</code></pre>

            <p>Notice that the mean of these new numbers is 0. Subtracting a dataset's mean from each item in the dataset will always have this effect.</p>

            <p>Here's are two histogram plots of some random data. The chart on the left shows the original data, the one on the right is the same data after it has been "demeaned"</p> 

            <img class='screenshot-large' src="./img/demeaned.png">

            <p>Notice how the shape of the histogram has not changed, but that the bins are now centered over 0.</p>

            <h4 id="dot-product">Dot Product</h4>
            <p>The dot product (AKA inner product) of two lists is calculated by multiplying corresponding items together and summing up the results. For example, for two lists, $X$ and $Y$ (which must be of identical length), their dot product would be:</p>
            <p>$$ X \cdot Y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i $$</p>
            <p>In other words, given these two lists:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">X = [1, 2, 3]
Y = [5, 6, 7]</code></pre>

            <p>Their dot product would be:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-text">(1 * 5) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 7) = 38</code></pre>


            <h4 id="variance">Variance</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/2/21/variance-co-variance-and-correlation" target="_blank">variance</a> (often referred to as $s^2$ or "Var") tells us how much variability or spread there is in the data. It can be calculated by dividing the "sum of squares" by $n - 1$. </p>
            <p>$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}) ^ 2}{n-1}$$</p>
            <p>In other words, imagine you have 3 items: <code>[3,4,5]</code>. The mean ($\bar{x}$) is 4. So you would first "demean" each item by subtracting the mean from the item, then you would square that result. Finally, you add all of those squared values together:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-text"># Demean the items, by subtracting the mean from each one
3 - 4 = -1
4 - 4 = 0
5 - 4 = 1

# Square the differences
-1 * -1 = 1
 0 * 0 = 0
 1 * 1 = 1

# Add together all of the squared values:
sum of squares = 1 + 0 + 1</code></pre>

            <p>Notice that if we hadn't squared the demeaned values, adding them all together would have just given us 0. As mentioned previously, this is true for any set of data, because demeaning the data "recenters" the mean to be at 0. </p>
            
            <p>To avoid this problem without giving up the other statistical advantages of centering the data, we square the differences before adding them together.</p>
            
            <h4 id="standard-deviation">Standard Deviation</h4>
            
            <p>The <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a> ($s$), is simply the square root of the variance.</p>
            
            <p>Like the variance, it also describes the spread of the data, but in a way that is more intuitive to understand because it uses the same units as the original data.</p>

            <h4 id="covariance">Covariance</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/2/21/variance-co-variance-and-correlation" target="_blank">covariance</a> of two lists, $X$ and $Y$, will tell us how the values in $X$ change in relation to the values in $Y$. (For example, does $Y$ increase as $X$ decreases, or vice versa, and if so, by what proportion?)</p>
            <p>It can be calculated as follows:</p>
            <p>$$\text{Covariance(X,Y)} = \frac{\Sigma(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{n-1}$$</p>
            <p>Notice that the numerator of the covariance is the dot product of the demeaned versions of $X$ and $Y$.</p>


            <h4 id="correlation-coefficient">Correlation Coefficient</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/2/21/variance-co-variance-and-correlation" target="_blank">correlation coefficient</a> ($r$) is a <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18082/how-would-you-explain-the-difference-between-correlation-and-covariance" target="_blank">normalized version</a> of the covariance. This makes it easier to use in comparisons. </p>
            <p>Once you have functions to calculate the covariance and the standard deviation, calculating the correlation coefficient is easy. </p>
            <p>The correlation coefficient can be calculated  by dividing the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ by the square root of the variance of $X$ times the variance of $Y$:</p>
            <p>$$r = \frac{Covariance(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X) \cdot Var(Y)}}$$</p>

            <h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>

            <p>We'll use the <code>numpy</code> library and some basic statistics to build a <code>SimpleCorrelator</code> class to calculate the correlation between ice cream sales and temperature.</p>

            <p>You are encouraged to use a Jupyter Notebook for this exercise. If you have installed Anaconda, you should be able to run <code>jupyter notebook</code> in a terminal window. This starts the network server and then opens the main notebook page in a browser. From here, you can create and run new notebooks.</p>

            <p>To help get started, please download the following notebook: <a href="./cs450_01_python_practice.ipynb" download>cs450_01_python_practice.ipynb</a></p>

            <h4>Part I: Build the class</h4>
            <aside class="pull-left"><p>Note: When working with the numpy library, it is conventional to import it like this:</p><p><pre><code class="python">import numpy as np</code></pre></p></aside>
            <ol>
                <li><p>First, create a python class called <code>SimpleCorrelator</code> that has the following methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>A constructor that takes two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and stores them as member variables.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A method called <code>x</code> which will return the <code>x</code> data.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A method called <code>y</code> which will return the <code>y</code> data.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p>Create the following numpy arrays containing sales and temperature data:</p>
<pre><code class="python"># sales
sales = np.array([464.37,520.38,531.62,532.25,605.11,649.96,
                  432.75,438.40,410.72,598.27,437.15,441.57,
                  873.65,517.76,540.26,619.77,794.61,617.84,
                  351.75,727.77,504.56,564.19,697.12,461.50,
                  847.23,240.27,597.32,846.17,703.07,718.93,
                  622.53,544.62,510.13,608.06,597.89,487.62,
                  544.40,459.84,372.08,614.82,510.07,738.32,
                  756.48,360.73,271.03,533.69,586.78,743.36,
                  471.53,579.69])

# temperatures
temps = np.array([73.75,66.56,87.54,78.79,82.35,80.50,
                  76.09,74.13,74.83,76.13,76.41,72.08,
                  86.30,72.82,75.10,81.44,84.11,85.19,
                  70.34,81.89,78.31,78.35,89.29,77.31,
                  84.41,71.94,80.34,90.42,83.31,83.32,

                  83.00,69.97,61.72,77.11,76.07,85.83,
                  72.72,75.16])
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><p>Create an instance of your <code>SimpleCorrelator</code> class, passing in your <code>sales</code> and <code>temps</code> data as x and y, respectively.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Part II: Create some statistical functions</h4>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Add a <code>data_summary</code> method to your <code>SimpleCorrelator</code> class that will calculate and return a string containing the size, mean, variance, and standard deviation of both the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> datasets.</p> 
                <p>You should use the numpy methods to calculate these statistics.</p>
                <p>Print out the results of the <code>data_summary</code> method to make sure it works as expected.</p>
<pre><code class="python">summary = myInstance.data_summary()

print(summary)

# prints something like (your numbers will be different):
X - Summary
  size: 50, mean: 23.3, variance: 123, stdev: 12.3

Y - Summary
  size: 50, mean: 123.3, variance: 233, stdev: 142.3
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><p>Override the <code>__repr__</code> method of your class so that when you print your class instance, it will print the results of your <code>data_summary</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="python">print(myInstance)

# prints something like (your numbers will be different):
X - Summary
  size: 50, mean: 23.3, variance: 123, stdev: 12.3

Y - Summary
  size: 50, mean: 123.3, variance: 233, stdev: 142.3
</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part III: Calculate the correlation coefficient</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Add a method called <code>correlation</code> to your class that returns the correlation coefficient as a single value.</p>
                <p>Note that there are several ways you could get this value. You could calculate it manually using the formulas provided above, or you could use a numpy method to do so.</p>
                <p>However, many numpy methods will return a matrix of values. You will need to make sure that your method returns a scalar (single value) which represents the correlation between X and Y.</p>
                <p>For example, this correlation coefficient matrix:</p>
                <table class="data-table">
                    <tr><td></td><td>X</td><td>Y</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>X</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Y</td><td>0.4</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>Shows that X and Y have a correlation coefficient of 0.4. Notice that X and Y are each perfectly correlated with themselves (X vs X and Y vs Y both have values of 1.0). Also notice that X vs Y and Y vs X have the same correlation coefficients.</p>
                <p>So if this were our correlation coefficient matrix, then our <code>correlation</code> method should return a value of <code>0.4</code>.</p>
                <p>It may not make sense to return a matrix of values in this situation, but often we're generating correlation coefficients between many different variables, trying to determine which are mostly tightly correlated with each other.</p>
                <p>If everything works correctly, the answer you get should be around <code>0.8</code>.</p>
            </li>
